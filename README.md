# RayTracingOneWeekend

A basic single frame raytracer based on the book by Peter Shirely, found [here](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
Written in C++ as a small project to gain greater understanding of both the language and the field of computer graphics and raytracing.
